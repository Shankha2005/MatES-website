# mates-next

Scaffolded Next.js project to host the converted static site.

Getting started (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# install deps
npm install

# run dev server
npm run dev

# build
npm run build
npm start
```

Place your existing static files (HTML/CSS/JS/img) into `public/` and I'll wire them into pages or components.
